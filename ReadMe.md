Lustd

![Lustd Logo](Assets/Lustd-Branding.png)

Lusted is a set of WPF styles that aspire to be, as the name purports, less ugly than the default style present in a raw WPF project.

You will find no claims of excellence, completeness, nor beauty here; for projects larger than a knick-knack, something more complete and established would likely deliver more satisfaction. 

That aside, Lustd was created to simplify consistency and appearance among my own tools and projects, and intends not to over promise nor underdliver.
